Subnets:
    AWS Reserves 5 IPs per subnet which are not host assignable

    The five are: Assume 10.0.0.0/24
        10.0.0.0 -- Network address
        10.0.0.1 Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
        10.0.0.2 Reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon provided DNS
        10.0.0.3 Reserved by AWS for future use
        10.0.0.255 Network Broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC


        Need 29 assignable ips to hosts. What is the minimum subnet prefix

            10.0.0.0/24 -> 256 - 5 = 251 assignable
            /25 -> 128
            /26 -> 64 - 5 = 58 assignable
            /27 -> 32 - 5 = 26 assignable 
            /28 -> 16

    NAT instances
        Need to disable source/destination checks on NAT instance
        In route table you add a route to a target instance

    NAT Gateway
        AWS managed NAT, higher bandwidth, availability, no admin
        Pay by hour for usage and bandwidth
        Resilient within a single AZ

        Must create mltiple NAT Gateway in Multiple AZ for fault tolerance
        There is no cross AZ failover b.c if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT 

    
DNS Resolution
    Private Hosted Zones in Route53 requires VPC to have enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport to be true

Network ACLS vs SG
    NACL gets evaluated before the SG

    Outbound for SG is stateful. In other words, if the request was allowed by inbound rule, then implied response is allowed.
    NACL is stateless, so it could get denied still

VPC Peering
    Must not overlap subnet CIDR
    Not transitive. VPC A -> VPC B -> VPC C
    Must update route tables in each VPCs subnet to ensure instaces can communicate
    Can do peering with other AWS account (cross account)
    Can work inter-region, cross account
    You can reference a security group of a peered VPC

    

VPC Endpoints
    Used to talk to AWS Managed services within a private network
    Edit NACL / route table to setup. Not out of the box
    Scales horizontally and are redundant
    Removes the need of IGW, NAT etc to access AWS services
    Interface: 
        Provisions ENI (Private IP address) as an entry point
    Gateway: provisions a target and must be used in a route table. S3 and DynamoDB

    Issues:
        Check DNS setting resolution in VPC
        Check Route Tables


VPC Flow Logs
    Can send to cloud watch logs or S3 bucket


Bastion Hosts


Site to Site VPN 
    VPG
        VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
        VGW is ceated and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the site to site VPN connection 
        Possibility to customize the ASN

    Customer Gateway
        Software application or physical device on customer side of the VN connection
        IP Address:
            Use static, public IP for customer gateway device
            if behind CGW behind NAT, use public IP instead of NAT


Direct connect
    Provides dedicated private connection from a remote netwrok to your VPC
    Dedicated Connections: 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps capacity
    Hosted Connections: 50 Mpbs, 500 Mbps, 10 Gbps

    Lead times are often longer than 1 month to establish connection

    Data in transit is not encrypted, but is private
    Need to combine AWS Direct Connect + VPN provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection
    Good for extra level of security, but slightly more complex to put in place

    Direct Connect Gateways:
        If you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC n many regions (same account), you must use a direct connect gateway

EGress only internet gateway
    Works only for IPV6
    similar function as NAT, but NAT is for ipv4
    IPV6 are all public addresses
    IPV6 addresses are internet facing only, but we dont want to expose our systems
         
AWS PrivateLink
    VPC Endpoint Services

    Option 1: make it public
    Option 2: VPC peering
    Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPC (own or other accounts )
    Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables
    Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC and ENI customer VPC)
    If the NLB, is in muliple AZ and ENI in MAZ, the solution is fault tolerant


AWS ClassicLink
    Ec2 classic: instances run in a single network shared with other customers
    Amazon VPC: your instances run logically isolated to your AWS account

    Classic link allows you to link EC2 classic instances to a VPC in your account

VPN CloudHub
    Provide secure communication between sites, if you have multiple VPN connections
    Low cost hub-spoke model for primary or secondary network connectivity between locations
    It is a VPN connection so it goes over the public internet

Transit Gateway
    A star hub and spoke connection.
    Regional resource can work cross region
    Share cross account using resource access manager (RAM)
    Supports IP Multicast

      1111

      1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15


max CIDR size in AWS is /16

33 addresses, 28 assignable

/28
    8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15
/27
    16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31
/26
    32 + 31 = 63, 64 - 5 = 59


Networking Costs: 
    Any traffic inbound is free
    Any traffic between EC2 instances within AZ are free
    When using an elastic / public IP, will charge .02 per GB
    .01 if using private IP

    Inter-region: .02 / GB
    Use Private IP instead of Public IP for good savings and better network perf
    Use same AZ for maximum savings
