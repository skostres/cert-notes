EC2 Storage

EBS Volume
Network drive - implies latency
can be detached from one ec2 to another


It is locked to an AZ
Can move through snapshot

Have a provisioned capacity regardless how much is used.
Can increase as time goes on

Types:
    Gp2 : general purpose ssd volume that balances price and perfomance for a wide variety of workloads
    IO1 : mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads
    ST1 : Low cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads
    SC1 : Lowest cost HDD for less frequently accessed workloads

EBS Volumes are characterized in SIZE | Throughput | IOPS | 
Gp2 and IOI can be used as boot volumes
Only one ec2 can be attached at any given time

EFS
- Many Ec2 instances can be attached and share the same storage
