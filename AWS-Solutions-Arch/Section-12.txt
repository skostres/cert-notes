CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-signed URL
    -Cloudfront:
        Allow access to a path, no matter the origin
        Account wide key pair
        Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration

AWS Global Accelerator
    Scenario, global geographic user base
    Unicast IP: one server holds one IP
    Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one

    Uses AWS internal network to route to your application


    Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB (ELB), NLB, public or private
    Consistent performance
        Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover


Cloudfront vs Global Accelerator
    Both uses edge locations and global AWS network 
    Both services leverage AWS shield for DDoS protection

    Cloudfront
        Improves perf both cacheable content
        Dynamic content (api acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
        Content served at the edge

    Global Accelerator
        Improves perf for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
        Proxying packets at the ede to applications running in one or more AWS regions
        Good fit for non-http use cases
        Good for HTTP use cases require static IP addresses
        Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
