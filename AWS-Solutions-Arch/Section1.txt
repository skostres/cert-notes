EC2 Instance Types
- On Demand {Workload schedules unpredictable}
- Reserved {No upfront, partial upfront, full upfront}
    Reserved Instance: Long workloads
    Convertable reserved instances: Long workloads with flexible instances
    Scheduled reserved instances: Every Thursday 3 - 6pm.
- Spot Instance {Can be reclaimed anytime by AWS}
- Dedicated Hosts {For regulatory, BYOL scenarios}

R: apps with high RAM usage
C: High compute
M: Balanced - general web app workloads
I: Good local I/O - databases
G: applications with GPU processing needs


T2 / T3: Burstable workloads
T2 / T3: Unlimited burst


AMI: - Amazon Machine Image
- AMIs are stored in S3
- To create image, go to EC2 Instances -> right click instance -> Create Image.
- Images will exist under the EC2 -> Images -> AMI
- need to copy the image to other regions to make it available for instance creation in that region.
- Cross Account AMI Copy:
    Can share between accounts, but need to provide permissions to EBS snapshot or S3 bucket 
    Sharing the AMI does not change ownership of the AMI.
    The party that receives access can go and provision their own instances and create their own AMIs
    Can't copy an encrypted AMI. If the keys were shared, you can copy and re-encrypt with your own
    Can't copy an AMI with a billingProduct code that was shared with you from another account. Such as Windows / Marketplace AMIs.
    Must first deploy the AMI, then create an image from the instance.
- To share access, right click the image, and then enter the AWS Account Number to share with.


EC2 Placement groups:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html
- Sometimes you want control over the EC2 Instance placement strategy
- When creating a placement group, these strategies are available:
    1. Cluster - Places instances into a low latency group in a single AZ
        Pro: Great network access between instances
        Con: if rack fails, all instances impacted
        uses: Big data jobs, ultra low latency jobs
    2. Spread - Places instances across different physical hardware. (7 instances per group per AZ)
        limit: Max of seven instances per AZ. Does not support Dedicated instance types
        uses: critical apps
        pro: Span across AZ, reduced risk to simultaneous failure
        con: Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement
    3. Partition - Places each partition into isolated hardware. Each partition has independent network and power source. A partition has x number of instances
        limit: Dedicated Instances can have max two partitions
        uses: Hadoop / Cassandra, kafka
        pro: Up to 7 partitions per AZ
        con: A failure can impact many EC2 instances, but not other partitions


Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-elastic-network-interfaces-in-the-virtual-private-cloud/
- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
- The ENI can have many attributes:
    Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary
    One elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
    One public IPv4
    One or more security groups
    A MAC address
You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly on EC2 Instances for failover.
Bound to a specific AZ


EC2 Hibernate:
- RAM state is written to EBS root volume
- Use cases long running processing
- Services that take a long time to initialize
- Available for On demand / reserve instances
- Cannot hibernate more than 60 days
- Ram size < 150 GB
