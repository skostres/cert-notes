        Can be used to delete incomplete multi part uploads
     

    
Source image:
    Need to be retrievable immediately for 45 days and afterwards, can wait 6 hours
    Upload in standard S3, move to Glacier standard class after 45 days
Thumbnail image:
    Only needs to be kept for 45 days. One zone IA b.c can be recreated with source image
    Delete rule after 45 days

Scenario:
    Recover deleted S3 objects immediately for 15 days
    Recover deleted S3 objects up to 365 days from deletion within 48 hours


    Standard S3 with versioning, move to glacier deep archive bulk for deleted objects 
    After 365 days, permanently delete object
